##Title Ideas
* Chasing the Sunset
* Rearview Memories
* Silent Passengers
* Longest Drive
* Rusted Frame

## Game Description:
Pack your bags and hit the road in Chasing the Sunset, a relaxing adventure through vibrant landscapes. Capture the beauty of each destination with your camera, play fun mini-games as you travel, and bond with your family during the ultimate road trip.
As the miles pass, the journey feels different in ways you canâ€™t quite put your finger on. Each stop is a new memory, but some moments seem to fade as quickly as they arrive. What awaits you at the end of the road?
